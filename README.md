### Features Left to Implement

- About page: Not enough time to complete an about page. It would be used to inform the user of:
  - The goal and purpose of the site
  - Current features and when they were implemented
  - Future features
  - All references for any text, images and media used. 
  - Small bio about the creator of this site.

- Console Library: A library containing all Video games consoles ever released. This library would allow users to quickly find and select a console they wish to find more information on. Once clicked the user will be taken to a unique page for that console full of further information, images, videos and more about that console. The user will be easily able to navigate back and continue to browse the rest of the console selection in the library. The consoles will be seperated based on Manufacturer, but will all contain hyperlinks allowing for navigation between them.

- Hand-held consoles: Would like to expand upon the original site and integrate the history of Hand-held consoled.
- Peripherals: The evolution of the controllers and many peripherals.
- DRM & Storage medium: Like the two previous, this subject has a lot of interesting information that tied into and played a key role in the development of the Home Video Games Console 
- Redesign sticky navbar to be accomodated better on smaller devices.
