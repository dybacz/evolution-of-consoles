# The Evolution of Games Consoles

This site has is meant for all audiences, yound and old. It was developed to give a overview and breakdown of the Evolution of the Homes video console through the use of any informative timeline.

This site splits up the consoles and compares them from one generation to the next.

I wish to accomplish an informative website that uses will keep coming back to 

In this section, you will include one or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Essentially, this part is your sales pitch. At this stage, you should have a name for your project so use it! Don’t introduce the project as a Portfolio project for the diploma. In this section, describe what the project hopes to accomplish, who it is intended to target and how it will be useful to the target audience. 

For example; Love Running is a site that hopes to help keep people motivated to meet up for runs on a regular basis in Dublin, Ireland. The site will be targeted toward runners who are looking for a way to socialise and keep themselves fit. Love Running will be useful for runners to see exactly when and where they should be to join the running club.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- About page: Not enough time to complete an about page. It would be used to inform the user of:
  - The goal and purpose of the site
  - Current features and when they were implemented
  - Future features
  - All references for any text, images and media used. 
  - Small bio about the creator of this site.

- Console Library: A library containing all Video games consoles ever released. This library would allow users to quickly find and select a console they wish to find more information on. Once clicked the user will be taken to an a unique page for that console full of further information, images, videos and more about that console. The user will be easily able to navigate back and continue to browse the rest of the console selection in the library. The consoles will be seperated based on Manufacturer but will all contain hyperlinks allowing for navigation between them.

- Hand-held consoles: Would like to expand upon the original site and integrate the history of Hand-held consoled.
- Peripherals: The evolution of the controllers and many peripherals.
- DRM & Storage medium: Similar to the two previous, this subject has a lot of interesting information that tied into and played a key role in the development of the Home Video Games Console 

-Redesign sticky navbar to be accomodated better on smaller devices.
