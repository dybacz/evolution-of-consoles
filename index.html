                        </figure>
                        <p>It all began in 1967 with the development of a bulky, rectangular, wooden box wih two controllers attached. Simply nicknamed as "Brown Box" it was the seventh prototype created by Ralph H.Baer and his developer colleagues at Sanders Associates, Inc. Originally named TV Game Unit #7 the machine was devised to run spot-based games and could be programmed to play a variety of games by flipping the switches on the front of the unit with Program cards being used to show the configuration of switches needed for any game.</p>
                        <p>Seven simple games were developed for the console: ping-pong, tennis, handball, volleyball, checkers, a target-shooting game that used a light-gun and finally a golf putting game, which required the use of a special attachment. The console was also designed so that it could be hooked up to any TV at the time.</p>
                        <p>The “Brown Box” was conceived by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_H._Baer" target="_blank">Ralph H.Baer</a> and is truly the first multiplayer, multiprogram game system, considered by many to be the first ever home video games console. Because of this, many people today see Ralph H.Baer as "The Father of Video Games".</p>
                        <p>When he was developing the “Brown Box” Ralph H.Baer recalled, “The minute we played ping-pong, we knew we had a product. Before that we weren’t too sure.” The “Brown Box” later became the basis for the first commercial home video game console, with the device being licensed to Magnavox  but it wouldn’t be until 1972 when this device would hit the market and become available to consumers.</p>
                        <p>This prototype is now owned by the National Museum of American History with a replica constructed by Baer on display at the National Videogame Museum.</p>

                        <p>In one revolutionary step the humble television set was transformed from a passive device into an interactive one, with home entertainment changed forever. Magnavox released the first commercially available official home video game system known as the Magnavox Odyssey. Just like in the film industry where the earliest films do not feature colour or recorded sound, the first video game console lacked the same basic features we take for granted today; colour and sound.</p>
                        <p>The system was so lacking in complexity that all of the Odysseys games were composed of a maximum of three square dots and a single, vertical line - all monochrome - which was all the system was capable of processing. Games were stored on printed circuit boards that plugged directly into the console and to add a little colour and variety, plastic overlays were provided with these circuit boards, which could be placed directly onto the television screen.</p>
                        <p>To control the action, dials were used rather than buttons and a directional stick. The only button on the system was the one to reset the game. The Odyssey also provided gaming with its first peripheral - a light gun.</p>

Along with Ted Dabney and Allan Alcorn, they were inspired by the computerised creativity of the Odysseys tennis game Bushnell wisely sensed a niche and began working on a coin-operated arcade game called Pong. The game was released in 1973 and was a hit and had such popularity that ATARI developed their first home video game console and released it in 1975 as <a href="./consoles/ataripong.html">Home Pong.</a></p>

                    <p>The Fairchild Channel F (known as the Grandstand in the UK) became the first home video games console to employ a microprocessor, heralding a new era of colour and sound. The second generation came to be defined by the use of the microprocessor and the replacement of the printed circuit boards with cartridges able to store complete games on, the beginning of the use of an separate external storage medium. The controllers saw a change from analog dials to directional joysticks.</p>

                    <p>A small Japanese playing-card company founded in 1889 had started to get into the electronic gaming industry. It had secured the rights to distribute Magnavox's Odyssey system in Japan during 1974. Bolstered by this win, Nintendo began manufacturing their first of many consoles, the “Nintendo Color TV Game Series” which was only released in Japan. Color TV Game 6 was the first of many models that came to market up until 1979. Nintendo would later go on to become a major player in the video gaming industry for the next three decades and one of the biggest and most successful companies of all time in the industry.</p>
                    <p>The Colour TV Game Six produced no less than six variations of electronic tennis, these were essentially a copy of Pong, the system also had a built-in Volleyball and Hockey game, each featuring singles and doubles mode. On the console itself, players controlled their "paddles" through built-in dials attached directly to the machine. </p>

                    <p>Over the last 12 years Nintendo had reinvented itself in the video game industry. In 1983 it set a new standard with the introduction of the Famicon in Japan later rebranded as Nintendo Entertainment System or “NES”, released worldwide in 1985. It opened the door for a multitude of features that are became standards such as 8-bit processors which allowed 5 bits of colour (25-32 colours), 5 audio channels and the use of sprites & tiles.</p>
                    <p>The biggest change came in making games that were story-driven, putting the user in the role of the character they controlled, rather than an external individual "playing" a game. The emotional drive of this experience took the industry to the next level with developers daring to try new things. The golden age of video gaming had arrived! With progressively advancing technology the 1980s was a period of game and genre innovation with the industry finally experimenting with fighting, platform, adventure and RPG games.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>In this context, there was a growing subculture forming around gaming. The NES's physical hardware was a big part of the persistence and growth of the console. The iconic controller was designed as a cross-shaped joypad featuring two actions buttons. The NES also came with a whole range of peripherals designed to extend and enhance gameplay. Due to all this the NES emerged victorious as the best-selling console of this generation single-handedly lifting Nintendo to the top of the gaming industry.</p>

                    <p>As far as the 8-bit era goes, the only other contender competing with the NES was the Sega Master System, first released in 1985 in Japan then Worldwide in 1986. After undergoing several re-brands in development before finally arriving at the "Master System" model name, it did not gain enough traction to compete with the already popular NES. By the time it was out of production in 1992, it had only managed to sell 1.5 million to 2 million units in the U.S. What it lacked in sales for consoles, it made up with in-gaming options thanks to the unsung heroes in its games. </p>

                    <p>The SEGA Master System was designed to provide console gamers with "Arcade" experiences at home. Meaning they could enjoy the novelty of games like Taito's Bubble Bobble, Out Run, Space Harrier, After Burner and many more in the comfort of there home. These enjoyable games made up a wide library highly memorable experiences, which propped up the SEGA Master System for as long as it ran. In terms of visuals, the Master System was superior with NES sprites usually having strange transparency issues and washed out colours. Whereas SEGAs “Arcade" promise meant that the Master System delivered brighter, truer colours, richer levels with hidden stages and alternate endings. </p>

The SEGA Genesis looking and feeling like a console far more visionary than any of its contemporaries, was released in 1988. Black and nearly matte, the console resembled a late 90s CD player, rather than a clunky, boxy cassette player. Its controller had improved on innovations made in GEN II, with a four-way control pad on the left and a three diagonally aligned buttons on the right. </p>

                    <p>The Genesis was marketed as “cutting-edge” due to what was named "blast processing", which was mostly a gimmick, but referred to the Genesis having: a faster CPU and more VRAM bandwidth than the SNES and a VDP graphics chip. The idea of "blast processing" served the brand well because its most popular game had a character, storyline, performance, and play that focused on speed: Sonic the Hedgehog</p>

                    <p>The war between Nintendo and Sega continued in generation 4 with the introduction of the Sega Genesis in 1988, Nintendo responded in 1990 with the release of their next generation console, called, the Super NES or SNES. This console was released under a few different names around the world: in Japan, it was dubbed the Super Famicom, and in South Korea, it was called the Super Comboy. The SNES boasted upgraded 16-bit graphics over the NES and even survived as 32-bit games became popular. The SNES was also the first console with left and right “shoulder” buttons on the controller. More than 49 million Super Nintendo consoles were sold worldwide! Meanwhile classic game companies such as Atari started to fade into obscurity and were eventually swept under the rug until nostalgia gamers revive them later in time.</p>

Nintendo set out on focusing on perfecting the player’s experience. While the Genesis focused on hardware superiority, Nintendo game developers pushed the design and narratives of their gameplay, creating a really in-depth and emotional experience for the player. The SNES was powered by two custom graphics chips and a powerful audio unit. It shifted focus away from the novelty of arcade games and into the immersive experience of cinema.</p>

                    <p>In this generation the war between Sega and Nintendo continued and a new competitor was set to join the race. Two of the key consoles of this generation were both introduced worldwide in 1995 and challenged the SNES' ongoing dominance. Sega released the Saturn system first, five months ahead of schedule and was their first 32-bit console that played games on CDs rather than cartridges. The early release was to beat Sony’s first foray into video games, the Playstation, which sold for less than the Saturn when it launched later that year. While the Saturn sold surprisingly well, it was found to have several technical flaws but established several key game series for Sega going forward.</div>

                    <p>The first Sony PlayStation was a fifth generation console that marked the electronic giant's third attempt at entering the gaming market. This first console was remarkable in many of the innovations and precedents it set. The PlayStation moved away from clunky Nintendo cartridges and, took inspiration from the previous generation by storing games on CDs. The CD ROM capabilities of the console allowed games to be larger in size allowing for richer, more complex games and enhanced graphics. The PlayStation, in addition to using optical media, also introduced the use of memory cards as to save the state of a game. These memory cards allowed games to have much longer gameplay and narrative elements, leading to highly successful role-playing games. The Playstation also innovated controller design with the first controller to introduce revolutionary dual thumbsticks and "force feedback" named "DualShock" controllers. This level of interactivity would go one to become the gold standard for all game controllers.</p>

In that same year, 100,000 units had been initially released and sold in two days.  By 1996 Seven million units had sold worldwide, the PlayStation became the best-selling console over the SNES. The sheer success of that number would be nothing compared to the next version of the Sony PlayStation. While Nintendo and SEGA have been chugging along and duking it out Sony had emerged victorious from the fifth generation. PlayStation sales dwarfed that of its longer-established rivals and becoming a massive hit with both players and developers. The console's diverse library showcased the best of Eastern and Western game design across a wide variety of genres.</p>

                    <p>Nintendo released their next console, the Nintendo 64 in late 1996. Known to many games as the "N64", this console ushered in the age of 3D game development and gameplay. As a fifth-gen console, it significantly juiced up its graphics and capabilities thanks to the addition of a 64-bit processor. Unlike other fifth generation units, it still used game cartridges, as Nintendo believed the load-time advantages of cartridges over CD-ROMs was still essential, as well as their ability to continue to use lockout mechanisms to protect copyrights. The system also included support for memory cards as well.</p>

                    <p>It was the first console to feature a four-way split-screen, with four-controller ports and had a very contemporary controller design that used an analog stick, rather than a joypad. Split-screen didn't produce a significant lag. That was thanks to its more advanced motherboard and a memory interface operating at 500MHz, 10 times faster than any other DRAM. Nintendo developed a strong library of first-party titles for the console, but the Nintendo 64 was not able to match the PlayStation's sales. Even with this setback Nintendo stayed a key competitor in the home console market alongside Sony and Sega.</p>
                    <p>The big 3 consoles of this generation were the Sega Saturn, the Nintendo 64, and the Sony Playstation. This generation was defined by the introduction of CD-drives with only Nintendo sticking to the cartidge based system, and at this time Sega started to decline rapidly in the ranks of game consoles.</p>

                    <p>The Dreamcast was the pioneer back in 1998, It was the first home console to include a built-in modem to provide internet support and allow players to connect to the Sega network and play online games.  The new console also boasted a 128-bit processor, detachable memory units with visual controller displays that could be used to play simple games on the go. However, Sega found several technical issues that had to be resolved before its Western launch in 1999. Though its Western release was more successful than in Japan.</p>

                    <p>Unable to compete with Sony, the Dreamcast was the last system released by Sega, who in 2001 left the hardware market to focus on its software properties and became a multi-platform games publisher. Considered by many to be ahead of its time and looking back one of the greatest consoles ever made for several reasons, including its capability for online gaming it unfortunately was a commercial flop that ended Sega’s console efforts The Sixth Generation of consoles saw one contender drop out, a new contender takes its first steps, and a move towards online gaming.</p>

                    <p>In 2000, Sony upped their game yet again with the release of the PlayStation 2.

                    <p>The Playsation 2  was the first to feature support for DVD alongside CD-ROM, which allowed for larger storage and supported DVD playback; which was a huge selling point at the time. It also offered backward compatibility, so gamers could still play their library of Playsation games. While other consoles of the sixth generation had not anticipated this step, the PlayStation 2's introduction of backwards compatibility became a major design consideration of future generations. Along with a strong game library, the PlayStation 2 went on to sell 155 million units before it was discontinued in 2013 and remains one of the bestselling home video consoles of all time.</p>

Nintendo switched its cartridge-based Nintendo 64 opting for a proprietary optical miniDVD format, this deterred piracy, but robbed users of the ability to play DVDs and CDs although Gamecube was much cheaper than its rivals. Nintendo improved on the previous contemporary controller layout, deciding on less face buttons, removal of the Z-button from the back, switching to two analog sticks and the addition of 2 more shoulder buttons.</p>

Making huge strides It featured improved HD graphics, the first wireless console controller, network support, internal and external storage an a improved Xbox Live with a huge ecosystem of impressive features such as; online multiplayer services, digital stores, DLC, online social features and third-party streaming capabilities. Coupled with the movable add-on "Kinect" and its online gaming network access, the Xbox 360 created interactive experiences for its gamers, putting tech specs front and centre. Suddenly, gaming was not only immersive and story-driven, but also about the power of the actual console machine.</p>

All that power came at a high price; early models of the Xbox 360 were plagued by a consistent hardware fault known as "the Red Ring of Death" (RROD), which Microsoft spent over $1 billion correcting the problem. The Xbox 360 saw several hardware revisions over its lifetime which became a standard practice for Microsoft going forward. The Xbox 360 was backward compatible with about half of the original Xbox library.</p>

                      <p>Sony responded with the release of the PlayStation 3 as a competitor to the Xbox 360 in 2006. The PS3 incorporated a Blu-Ray player and a cell microprocessor capable of full 1080p HD Graphics, making it more expensive than Xbox or Wii. The only system at the time to play Blu-rays and was successful. Sony, for the first time, faced stiff competition from its rivals. Initial units shipped with a special Emotion Engine daughterboard that allowed for backwards compatibility of PlayStation 2 games, but later revisions of the unit removed this, leaving only software-based emulation for PlayStation games available. To compete with Xbox Live, the PlayStation Network was created with online services and a storefront as a free alternative. By now, Sony's PlayStation consoles had a mass following so the reception for the PS3 was unparalleled.</p>
                      <p>Sony banked on the Blu-ray format, which was included from the launch but initially had a slow start in the market, due to its high price, complex game development environment and initial lack of quality games. The PlayStation 3 eventually became more well received since Blu-Ray was now the new standard and over time following gradual price cuts, improved marketing campaigns and the eventual release of cheaper "slim" and "super slim" models, one at 250GB of hard drive and the second at 500GB saw Sony eventually claw back Microsoft's lead, but PS3 never sold as well as its predecessors. PS3 arrived as the successor to the two most successful games consoles of all time, but got off to a rocky start, and spent much of the generation playing catch-up. </p>

                      <p>In the heat of the console war between Sony and Xbox, things had been quiet at Nintendo until the release of its family-friendly alternative Wii console in 2006. Nintendo lacked the same manufacturing capabilities and relationships with major hardware supplies as Sony and Microsoft, and to compete, diverged on a feature-for-feature approach. The Wii was Nintendo's attempt at reviving both its sales and its image. It became clear that it was desperately trying to find its voice in this new era of digitally supported gaming.</p>
                      <p>After successive generations of dwindling sales, Nintendo tried something different and developed the Wii around the novel use of motion controls in which its new vertical, oblong controllers named the Wii remote. Allowing users to control a game with physical gestures and button-presses, thanks to motion sensors, infrared detection, and LEDs, when pointed at the sensor bar. Nintendo designed and offered plenty of add-ons and peripherals including the Wii nunchucks. The idea here was to "socialize" the consumer's living room, encouraging people to get up and be engaged their gameplay. The Wii may have lacked its rivals' HD Graphics and processing power, but it more than made up for it with the intuitiveness of its control mechanism.</p>

                      </figure>
                      <p>Nintendo also provided various online services for the Wii, including the Virtual Console where players could purchase emulated games from Nintendo's past consoles as well as games for the Wii. The Wii used regular DVDs for its game medium but also directly supported GameCube miniDVD. The Wii was considered a surprising success that many developers had initially overlooked, revitalizing Nintendo's fortunes. Its success saw Xbox and PlayStation quickly develop their own motion-control systems, Kinect and Move, respectively.</p>

                      <h1>Wii U</h1>
                      <h2>Nintendo's biggest failure</h2>
                      <span>Generation VIII</span>
                      <p>Launched in 2012, Wii U considered by Nintendo to be a successor to the Wii but geared to more serious players. The console was backwards-compatible with all original Wii games and its motion controls. The Wii U was capable of the 1080p HD graphics and performance typical of Sony and Microsoft's seventh-gen machines. Once again, Nintendo experimented with a new control device known as the GamePad; a hybrid touchscreen and games controller that acted as a second screen and enabled 'Off-TV' play at a limited range.</p>

                      </figure>
                      <p>Nintendo refined its network services to further develop the Nintendo Network and combine both storefront and online connectivity services. The Wii U did not sell as well as Nintendo had planned, they found people mistook the GamePad to be a tablet they could take with them away from the console, and the console struggled to draw the third-party developers as the Wii had. Wii U had poor sales in comparison to its illustrious predecessor, but its combination of portable and TV gaming set the groundwork for its popular successor.</p>

                      <p>Xbox 360 and PS3 had effectively tied the seventh generation, but any hopes Microsoft might have had of finally leapfrogging its rival were hamstrung by a series of high-profile missteps and U-turns during the initial promotion for its new Xbox One. It seemed as if all of those seventh-generation gains might be wiped out before you could say 'Xbox on'. PS4 ditched the complex architecture of its predecessor and focused more on core gamers. Retailers and gamers appreciated Sony's clearer messaging around second hand games. Tech-heads were impressed by the system's specifications compared to Xbox One, and the wider public by its lower price point. It seemed like the eighth generation could only go one way.</p>
                      <p>While the PS3 was powerful, it sported a "cell microprocessor", a complicated arrangement in which a central core chip delegated processing tasks to one of either other processing "elements" which was expensive to manufacture. It was also difficult for developers and designers to create games for the console. With the PS4, things were kept simple, it housed a classic x86 chip, a processor that works much like those of personal computers. This more streamlined architecture made things easier for developers, but its high-end quality gave an added kick of speed. The PS4's central processor brought together a CPU with a GPU and handled the two of them in tandem far more efficiently than the preceding cell microprocessor. This allowed the development team to open up the console (much in the way Microsoft had years before) to 16 game studios owned by Sony as well as 16 independent and external studios.</p>

                      <p>The Sony PS4 changed things for both consumers, game studios/designers and the developers working on the PS4 console release itself. This gave the gaming giant the chance to present more titles without significant investment into the gaming studios, encouraging indie game developers with their own cult followings to port their dedicated fans over to the PS4. PS4 developers also created a memory sub-system that anticipated 3D gaming years down the road. While the PlayStation network, much like the Xbox Live gaming network, was running like clockwork all these years, the open-source and more democratic approach to indie development was a necessity of the times.</p>

                      <p>In 2016, Sony upgraded the PS4 to compete with 4K upscaling offered by the Xbox One S. The new PlayStation 4 Pro was smaller, sleeker, and could also handle 4K upscaling. The PS4 went on to become Sony's most successful console since PS2. Sony’s current generation of PlayStation, the PS4, is the most advanced yet — introduced on the tail end of the Xbox One release. It has sharp graphics, VR capabilities using the PSVR headset, and an impressive library of games to choose from.</p>

                    <p>Intended to rival the PS4, the Microsoft released its eighth generation console the Xbox One in 2013 to generally good reviews and positive sales. It had a more refined controller design, voice navigation and a sleeker, smoother design. Like the PS4, the Xbox One relied on the x86 architecture, the same as in personal computers. The console placed an increased emphasis on cloud computing. Like the Xbox 360, it continued to offer Xbox Live and third-party streaming. The new console boasted improved computational power to support up to 60 frames per second at 1080p resolutions for some games, a sleek design, and support for a huge number of games.</p>

                    <p>Microsoft being cognisant of the social networking context that users are operating within, gave players the ability to record and share video clips or screenshots from gameplay, or live-stream directly to streaming services such as Mixer and Twitch. Digital distribution increased in popularity, while the addition and improvements to remote play capabilities became standard with second screen experiences via companion apps adding more interactivity to games. The eighth generation saw Microsoft attempt to design the Xbox One as an all-in-one home entertainment system. In the case of the Xbox One, the console's initial launch had included the Kinect device but this became highly controversial in terms of potential privacy violations and lack of developer support, and by its mid-generation refresh, the Kinect had been dropped and discontinued as a game device.</p>
                    <p>In 2016, Microsoft gave the Xbox One some major upgrades with the new Xbox One S. The updated console was smaller, could upscale games from 1080p to 4K, push for higher frame rates and stream 4K video. The Xbox One X was released in 2017, and offers even more graphics upgrades over the Xbox One S and PlayStation 4 Pro. The new Xbox One X supports 4k video and gameplay natively. It also boasts 40% more processing power than any other console on the market.</p>

                    <p>Xbox One is believed to have sold more units than the original Xbox, but fewer than Xbox 360. With very few titles remained format-exclusive, and thus the software libraries were largely identical. Controllers had been honed to homogeneous perfection, and non-gaming applications were largely interchangeable. With regular software patches and firmware updates, a wide array of apps and multimedia features, it could be argued that PS4 and Xbox One resemble nothing so much as gaming PCs. Which begs the question:<br><br>'Are these machines even consoles anymore?'<br><br>'Is the games console now a thing of the past?'</p>
