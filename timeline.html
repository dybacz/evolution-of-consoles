                        </figure>
                        <p>It all began in 1967 with the development of a bulky, rectangular, wooden box wih two controllers attached. Simply nicknamed as "Brown Box" it was the seventh prototype created by Ralph H.Baer and his developer colleagues at Sanders Associates, Inc. Originally named TV Game Unit #7 the machine was devised to run spot-based games and could be programmed to play a variety of games by flipping the switches on the front of the unit with Program cards being used to show the configuration of switches needed for any game.</p>
                        <p>Seven simple games were developed for the console: ping-pong, tennis, handball, volleyball, checkers, a target-shooting game that used a light-gun and finally a golf putting game, which required the use of a special attachment. The console was also designed so that it could be hooked up to any TV at the time.</p>
                        <p>The “Brown Box” was conceived by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_H._Baer" target="_blank">Ralph H.Baer</a> and is truly the first multiplayer, multiprogram game system, considered by many to be the first ever home video games console. Because of this, many people today see Ralph H.Baer as "The Father of Video Games".</p>
                        <p>When he was developing the “Brown Box” Ralph H.Baer recalled, “The minute we played ping-pong, we knew we had a product. Before that we weren’t too sure.” The “Brown Box” later became the basis for the first commercial home video game console, with the device being licensed to Magnavox  but it wouldn’t be until 1972 when this device would hit the market and become available to consumers.</p>
                        <p>This prototype is now owned by the National Museum of American History with a replica constructed by Baer on display at the National Videogame Museum.</p>

                    <h2>Birth of an Industry</h2>
                    <figure id="odyssey-box">

                        <h4>1972 - <span>Magnavox Odyssey</span></h4>
                        <p>In one revolutionary step the humble television set was transformed from a passive device into an interactive one, with home entertainment changed forever. Magnavox released the first commercially available official home video game system known as the Magnavox Odyssey. Just like in the film industry where the earliest films do not feature colour or recorded sound, the first video game console lacked the same basic features we take for granted today; colour and sound.</p>
                        <p>The system was so lacking in complexity that all of the Odysseys games were composed of a maximum of three square dots and a single, vertical line - all monochrome - which was all the system was capable of processing. Games were stored on printed circuit boards that plugged directly into the console and to add a little colour and variety, plastic overlays were provided with these circuit boards, which could be placed directly onto the television screen.</p>
                        <p>To control the action, dials were used rather than buttons and a directional stick. The only button on the system was the one to reset the game. The Odyssey also provided gaming with its first peripheral - a light gun.</p>

                        <h4>1975 - <span>Atari Home Pong System</span></h4>
                        <p>Back in 1972 a man named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Bushnell" target="_blank">Nolan Bushnell</a> founded his own games company called ATARI, Inc. Along with Ted Dabney and Allan Alcorn, they were inspired by the computerised creativity of the Odysseys tennis game Bushnell wisely sensed a niche and began working on a coin-operated arcade game called Pong. The game was released in 1973 and was a hit and had such popularity that ATARI developed their first home video game console and released it in 1975 as <a href="./consoles/ataripong.html">Home Pong.</a></p>

                    <h4>1976 - <span>Fairchild Channel F / Grandstand (UK)</span></h4>
                    <p>The Fairchild Channel F (known as the Grandstand in the UK) became the first home video games console to employ a microprocessor, heralding a new era of colour and sound. The second generation came to be defined by the use of the microprocessor and the replacement of the printed circuit boards with cartridges able to store complete games on, the beginning of the use of an separate external storage medium. The controllers saw a change from analog dials to directional joysticks.</p>

                    <h4>1977 - <span>Nintendo Color TV Game Series</span></h4>
                    <p>A small Japanese playing-card company founded in 1889 had started to get into the electronic gaming industry. It had secured the rights to distribute Magnavox's Odyssey system in Japan during 1974. Bolstered by this win, Nintendo began manufacturing their first of many consoles, the “Nintendo Color TV Game Series” which was only released in Japan. Color TV Game 6 was the first of many models that came to market up until 1979. Nintendo would later go on to become a major player in the video gaming industry for the next three decades and one of the biggest and most successful companies of all time in the industry.</p>
                    <p>The Colour TV Game Six produced no less than six variations of electronic tennis, these were essentially a copy of Pong, the system also had a built-in Volleyball and Hockey game, each featuring singles and doubles mode. On the console itself, players controlled their "paddles" through built-in dials attached directly to the machine. </p>

                    <h4>1977 - <span>ATARI 2600</span></h4>
                    <p>Atari releases their first multigame home video console that featured joysticks and interchangeable game cartridges that played multi-coloured games, effectively kicking off the second generation of the video game consoles. This console was a pivotal moment in gaming history due to its many innovations which became standards such as: external cartridge ROM storage, console design, microprocessor-based hardware and joystick controllers. </p>
                    <h4>1979 - <span>Mattel Intellivision</span></h4>
                    <p>Mattel launches the Intellivision with exceptional capabilities compared to anything else on the market. It intimidated the Atari 2600 with its superior capabilities but was unable to knock it off the top spot. The Atari 2600 remained the king of this generation owing to its cartridge based storage technology, better graphics and a larger library of games.</p>

                    <p>In North America an oversaturated game console market and a surplus of over-hyped, low-quality games, such as the infamous E.T. by Atari (<a href="https://archive.org/details/E.T._The_Extra-Terrestrial_1982_Atari_NTSC" target="_blank">Play for Free</a>) based on the film and considered the worst game ever made! Coupled with an increasing computer game market lead to the video game industry experiencing a major “crash”. This lasted a couple of years and led to many bankruptcies of several home computer and video game console companies.
